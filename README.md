# Book Tracker

**Book Tracker** is a Django project developed as a practical example for my article on "Performance Optimization with Django DebugÂ Toolbar" published on Medium. The project features a book list displayed on the home page, where users can explore books added by the admin. Each user can manage their personal book list by adding books, tracking reading progress (start/end dates), updating status, leaving ratings, and writing notes.
